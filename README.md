## Objective

Our project aims to create a **comprehensive disaster-response and drone management system** with the following specific objectives:
- **Optimize Drone Fleet Management**: Centralized platform to monitor, categorize, and track drone deployments for efficient response.
- **Automated Mission Planning**: Simplify task assignments, schedules, and real-time updates for coordinated search-and-rescue and supply missions.
- **Enhanced Data Collection**: Real-time data and analytics from drones, aiding in situational assessment and decision-making.
- **Efficient Resource Allocation**: Inventory tracking, replenishment alerts, and financial reporting to ensure availability of essential supplies.
- **Comprehensive Operator Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring, task management, and mission data access for operators.
- **Customizable System Settings**: Tailored system configuration to meet the unique needs of different disaster scenarios.
- **Administrative Interface**: Manage drone operations, operator profiles, and system-wide activities from a centralized dashboard.
